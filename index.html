        	<h1>Chicago's Shifting Geography of Violent Crime</h1>
            <p>With 2.7 million residents as of 2016, Chicago is the third largest city in the United States.  This map provides a glimpse at how crime rates varied over Chicago's 77 neighborhoods in 2015.  Shown here are five crimes that are defined by the FBI as  <font color="#ff4c4c"><b>violent</b></font> crimes: assault, burglary, robbery, sexual assault, and homicide.  These are crimes in which an offender uses or threatens force upon a victim.  Burglary is included here because it is often regarded as a violent crime by police and sentenced as such.  All crime types are listed as rates per 10,000 people.  </p>
